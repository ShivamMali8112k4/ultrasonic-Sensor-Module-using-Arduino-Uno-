# Project description

In this project I will introduce you to the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor.  It works by sending sound waves from the transmitter, which then bounce off of an object and then return to the receiver.  You can determine how far away something is by the time it takes for the sound waves to get back to the sensor.

# Conection's

VCC to 5V 

GND to GND 

Trig to pin 9 

Echo to pin 10 

# Output 

after uploading the code go to serial monitore and see it's working.
